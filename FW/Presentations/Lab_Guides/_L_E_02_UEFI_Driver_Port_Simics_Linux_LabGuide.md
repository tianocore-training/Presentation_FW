[tianocore.org](https://www.tianocore.org/)

---
## Slide 2 Lesson Objective 

First Setup for Building EDK II, See [Lab Setup](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_C_01_Build_Setup_Download_EDK_II_Win_LabGuide.md) then TENTATIVE LINK

- Compile a UEFI driver template created from UEFI Driver Wizard
- Test driver w/ Simics QSP Board using UEFI Shell 2.0
- Port code in the template driver

---
## Slide 3 Lab 1: UEFI Driver Template

Use this lab, if you''re not able to create a UEFI Driver Template using the UEFI Driver Wizard.

**Note:** Skip if LAB 1 UEFI Driver Wizard completed successfully

---
## Slide 4 Lab 1: Get UEFI Driver Template

If UEFI Driver Wizard does not work:

1. Copy the directory MkPkg from `.../FW/LabSampleCode/UefiDriverTemplate` to `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2`


(See PDF for screenshots)

Overwrite if SampleApp Lab Completed

Review [UEFI Driver Wizard Lab](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_E_01_UEFI_Driver_Wizard_WIN_LabGuide.md) for which protocols are being produced and which are being consumed

---
## Slide 5 Lab 2: Building a UEFI Driver

In this lab, you'll build a UEFI Driver created by the UEFI Driver Wizard. You will include the driver in the Emulator project. Build the UEFI Driver from the Driver Wizard.

---
## Slide 6 Compile a UEFI Driver

**Two Ways to Compile a Driver**


| Standalone | In a Project |
| --- | --- |
| The build command directly compiles the .INF file | Include the .INF file in the project's .DSC file |
| Results: The driver's .EFI file is located in the Build directory | Results: The driver's .EFI file is a part of the project in the Build directory |

---
##  Slide 7 Lab 2: Build the UEFI Driver

- Perform [Lab Setup - tentative link]() and platform (TENTATIVE LINK) from previous labs
- Open `edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/OpenBoard.dsc`
- Add the following to the [Components] section:

Hint: add to the last module in the [Components] section

```
# Add new modules here
	MkPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.inf
```

- Save and close the file OpenBoard.dsc


---
## Slide 8 Copy UefiAppLab.vhd file

Copy the UefiApplLab.vhd 

From `.../Lab_Material_FW/FW/LabSampleCode/AppLab/UefiAppLab.vhd` To `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57/targets/qsp-x86/images`

(See PDF for screenshots)

---
## Slide 9 Update the Simics Script

Update the Simics script to use the UefiAppLab.vhd image as a file system

Edit the file: qsp-modern-core.simics from `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-cpu-6.0.4/targets/qsp-modern-core.simics`

Add the following line:

```
$disk1_image="%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/images/UefiAppLab.vhd"
```

Before the "run-command-file" line

Save qsp-modern-core.simics

**File: qsp-modern-core.simics**

```
Decl{
decl {
! Script that runs the Quick Start Platform (QSP) with a modern 
!   processor core. 

params from "%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/qsp-clear-linux.simics"  
default cpu_comp_class = "x86QSP2"  
default num_cores = 2  
default num_threads = 2
} 
$disk1_image="%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/images/UefiAppLab.vhdâ€œ

run-command-file "%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/qsp-clear-linux.simics"
```

---
## Slide 10 Build Platform BoardX58Ich10

Open another Terminal Prompt in `$HOME/fw/edk2-ws` then cd to edk2 to do edksetup.sh

```bash
$ cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2 
$ . edksetup.sh
```

Then cd to:

```bash
$ cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel
```

Invoke the Python Build script for Simics OpenBoard QSP

```bash
$ python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10 -t GCC5
```

Copy `~/fw/edk2-ws/Build/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/DEBUG_GCC5/FV/BOARDX58ICH10.fd` To `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57/targets/qsp-x86/images`

$> ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics 
simics> run
```
Press "F2" at the logo, then Select "Boot Manager" followed by "EFI Internal Shell"

At the UEFI Shell prompt

```
Shell> Fs1:
FS1:/> Load MyWizardDriver.efi
```

```
Shell> FS1:
FS1:\> load MyWizardDriver.efi
Image 'FS1:\MyWizardDriver.efi' loaded at DDD3B000 - Success
FS1:\> 
```

Build ERRORS: Copy the solution files from `/FW/LabSampleCode/LabSolutions/LessonC.1` to `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver`

---
## Slide 13 Lab 2: Test Driver

At the shell prompt type:

```
FS1:/> drivers
```

Verify the UEFI Shell loaded the new driver. The drivers command will display the driver information and a driver handle number ("ff" in the example screenshot)

(See PDF for screenshot)

---
## Slide 14 Lab 2: Test Driver

At the shell prompt using the handle from the drivers command, type:

```
dh -d ff
```

**Note:** The value ff is the driver handle for MyWizardDriver. The handle vlaue may change based on your system configuration. 

(See PDF for screenshot)

---
## Slide 15 Lab 2: Test Driver

At the shell prompt using the handle from the drivers command, type:

```
FS1:/ > unload ff
```

See example screenshot (in PDF), type: `drivers` again

Notice the results of unload command

Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```

---
## Slide 16 Lab 3: Component Name

In this lab, you'll change the information reported to the drivers command using the ComponentName and ComponentName2 protocols.

---
## Slide 17 Lab 3: Component Name

- **Open** `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/ComponentName.c`

- **Change** the string returned by the driver from MyWizardDriver to: UEFI Sample Driver

```
/// Table of driver names
///
  GLOBAL_REMOVE_IF_UNREFERENCED
  EFI_UNICODE_STRING_TABLE mMyWizardDriverDriverNameTable[] = {
    { "eng;en", (CHAR16 *)L"UEFI Sample Driver" },
    { NULL, NULL }
  };
```

- **Save** and close the file: `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/ComponentName.c`

---
## Slide 18 Lab 3: Build and Test Driver

1. At the Terminal Command Prompt, Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

```

5. Type Drivers

```
FS1:/> Drivers
```

(See PDF for results screenshot)

6. Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```


---
## Slide 19 Lab 4: Porting the Supported & Start Functions

The UEFI Driver Wizard produced a starting point for driver porting ... so now what?

In this lab, you'll port the "Supported" and "Start" functions for the UEFI driver


---
## Slide 20 Lab 4: Porting Supported and Start

### Review the Driver Binding Protocol

- **Supported()** - Determines if a driver supports a controller
- **Start()** - Starts a driver on a controller & Installs Protocols
- **Stop()** - Stops a driver from managing a controller


---
## Slide 21 Lab 4: The Supported() Port

The UEFI Driver Wizard produced a Supported() function, but it only returns `EFI_UNSUPPORTED`

**Supported Goals:**

- Checks if the driver supports the device for the specified controller handle
- Associates the driver with the Serial I/O protocol
- Helps locate a protocol's specific GUID through UEFI Boot Services' function

---
## Slide 22 Lab 4: Help from Robust Libraries 

EDK II has libraries to help with porting UEFI Drivers

- `AllocateZeroPool()` include - \[Memory/AllocationLib.h\]
- `SetMem16()` include - \[BaseMemoryLib.h\]

Check the MdePkg with libraries help file (.chm format)

---
## Slide 23 Lab 4: Update Supported 

- **Open** `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.c`
- **Locate** `MyWizardDriverDriverBindingSupported()`, the supported function for this driver and comment out the "//" in the line: "return EFI_UNSUPPORTED; "

```
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
MyWizardDriverDriverBindingSupported (
  IN EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL  *This,
  IN EFI_HANDLE                   ControllerHandle,
  IN EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL     *RemainingDevicePath OPTIONAL
  )
{
  // return EFI_UNSUPPORTED;
}

```

- copy and paste (next slide)

---
## Slide 24 Lab 4: Update Supported Add Code

**Copy & Paste** the following code for the supported function

`MyWizardDriverDriverBindingSupported():`

```
EFI_STATUS                Status;
EFI_PCI_IO_PROTOCOL       *UsbIo;
Status = gBS->OpenProtocol (
                ControllerHandle,
                &gEfiUsbIoProtocolGuid,
		    (VOID **)&UsbIo,
                This->DriverBindingHandle,
                ControllerHandle,
                EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_BY_DRIVER EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_EXCLUSIVE
                );

if (EFI_ERROR (Status)) {
   return Status; // Bail out if OpenProtocol returns an error
}
 
  // We're here because OpenProtocol was a success, so clean up
   gBS->CloseProtocol (
      ControllerHandle,
      &gEfiUsbIoProtocolGuid,
      This->DriverBindingHandle,
      ControllerHandle
      );

   return EFI_SUCCESS;
```

---
## Slide 25 Lab 4: Notice UEFI Driver Wizard Includes

- **Open** `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.h
`
- **Notice** the following include statement is already added by the driver wizard:

```
// Consumed Protocols
//
#include <Protocol/UsbIo.h>
```

- **Review** the Libraries section and see that UEFI Driver Wizard automatically includes library headers based on the form information. Also, other common library headers were included

```
// Libraries
//
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
#include <Library/MemoryAllocationLib.h>
#include <Library/BaseMemoryLib.h>
#include <Library/BaseLib.h>
#include <Library/UefiLib.h>
#include <Library/DevicePathLib.h>
#include <Library/DebugLib.h>
```

---
## Slide 26 Lab 4: Update the Start()

- **Copy & Paste** the following in MyWizardDriver.c after the `#include "MyWizardDriver.h"` line:

```
#define  DUMMY_SIZE 100*16      // Dummy buffer
CHAR16   *DummyBufferfromStart = NULL;
```

**Locate** MyWizardDriverDriverBindingStart(), the start function for this driver and comment out the "//" in the line "`return EFI_UNSUPPORTED;`"

```
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
MyWizardDriverDriverBindingStart (
  IN EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL  *This,
  IN EFI_HANDLE                   ControllerHandle,
  IN EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL     *RemainingDevicePath OPTIONAL
  )
{
  // return EFI_UNSUPPORTED;
}
```

---
## Slide 27 Lab 4: Update Start Add Code

**Copy & Paste** the following code for the start function

`MyWizardDriverDriverBindingStart()`

```
BOOLEAN FirstAlloc = FALSE;

if (DummyBufferfromStart == NULL) {     // was buffer already allocated?
    DummyBufferfromStart = (CHAR16*)AllocateZeroPool (DUMMY_SIZE * sizeof(CHAR16));
    FirstAlloc = TRUE;
}
 
if (DummyBufferfromStart == NULL) {
    return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;    // Exit if the buffer is not there
} 

if (FirstAlloc) { 
   SetMem16 (DummyBufferfromStart, (DUMMY_SIZE * sizeof(CHAR16)), 0x0042);  // Fill buffer
)
 
return EFI_SUCCESS;
```

- Notice the Library calls to `AllocateZeroPool()` and `SetMem16()`
- The `Start()` function is where there would be calls to `gBS-InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()`

---
## Slide 28 Lab 4: Debugging before Testing the Driver

UEFI drivers can use the EDK II debug library

- `DEBUG()` inlcude - [DebugLib.h]

**DEBBUG()** Macro statements can show status progress interest points throughout the driver code

Simics Serial Console Output Debug Messages:

(See PDF for screenshot)

---
## Slide 29 Lab 4: Add Debug Statements Supported()

**Copy & Paste** the following `DEBUG()` macros for the supported function:

```
Status = gBS->OpenProtocol(
      ControllerHandle,
      &gEfiUsbIoProtocolGuid,
      (VOID **)&UsbIo,
      This->DriverBindingHandle,
      ControllerHandle,
      EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_BY_DRIVER | EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_EXCLUSIVE
      );
 
  if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
     DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "[MyWizardDriver] Not Supported /n"));
     return Status; // Bail out if OpenProtocol returns an error
  }
 
  // We're here because OpenProtocol was a success, so clean up
  gBS->CloseProtocol(
      ControllerHandle,
      &gEfiUsbIoProtocolGuid,
      This->DriverBindingHandle,
      ControllerHandle
      );
  DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "[MyWizardDriver] *** Supported SUCCESS ***/n"));
  return EFI_SUCCESS;
```

---
## Slide 30 Lab 4: Add Debig Statements Start()

**Copy & Paste** the following DEBUG macro for the Start function just before the `return EFI_SUCCESS;` statement

```c
DEBUG ((DEBUG_INFO, "/n*******/n***[MyWizardDriver] Buffer 0x%p  ***/n*******/n", DummyBufferfromStart));
return EFI_SUCCESS;
```

*Note:* This debug macro displays the memory address of the allocated buffer on the debug console

**Save** `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.c`

---
## Slide 31 Lab 4: Build and Test Driver

1. At the Terminal Command Prompt, Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

```bash
$> cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/
$> python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10  -t GCC5
```

2. Copy `MyWizardDriver.efi` from the build directory to the `VHD Disk`

```bash
$> cp ../Build/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/DEBUG_GCC5/X64/MyWizardDriver.efi ~/VHD
```

3. Run the firststeps script from Terminal Command Prompt:

```bash
$> ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics 
simics> run
```

4. At the Shell, Load Driver

```
Shell> fs1:
FS1:/> load MyWizardDriver.efi
```

```
Shell> fs1:
FS1:\> load MyWizardDriver.efi
Image 'FS1:\MyWizardDriver.efi' loaded at DDD3B000 - Success
FS1:\>
```

---
## Slide 32 Lab 4: Build and Test Driver

- Check the Simics Com[0] output.
- Notice Debug messages indicate the driver did not return EFI_SUCCESS from the "Supported()" function most of the time.
- See that the "Start()" function did get called and a Buffer was allocated.

(See PDF for screenshots)

*Note:* use the right-side scroll bar with mouse to scroll back to see the "Supported SUCCESS"

Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```

---
## Slide 33 Lab 5: Create a NVRAM Variable

In this lab you'll create a non-volatile UEFI variable (NVRAM), and set and get the variable in the Start function

Use Runtime services to "`SetVariable()`" and "`GetVariable()`"

---
## Slide 34 Lab 5: Adding a NVRAM Variable Steps

1. Create .h file with new `typedef` definition and its own `GUID`
2. Include the new .h file in the driver's top .h file
3. In the `Start()` make a call to a new function to set/get the new NVRam Variable
4. Before `EntryPoint()` add the new function `CreateNVVariable()` to the driver.c file.

---
## Slide 35 Lab 5: Create a new .h file

**Create** a new file in your editor called: "`MyWizardDriverNVDataStruc.h`"

**Copy, Paste** and then **Save** this file

```
#ifndef _MYWIZARDDRIVERNVDATASTRUC_H_
#define _MYWIZARDDRIVERNVDATASTRUC_H_
#include <Guid/HiiPlatformSetupFormset.h>
#include <Guid/HiiFormMapMethodGuid.h>
 
#define MYWIZARDDRIVER_VAR_GUID /
  { /
    0x363729f9, 0x35fc, 0x40a6, 0xaf, 0xc8, 0xe8, 0xf5, 0x49, 0x11, 0xf1, 0xd6 /
  }
#define MYWIZARDDRIVER_STRING_SIZE   0x1A

#pragma pack(1)
typedef struct {
    UINT16  MyWizardDriverStringData[MYWIZARDDRIVER_STRING_SIZE];
    UINT8   MyWizardDriverHexData;
    UINT8   MyWizardDriverBaseAddress;
    UINT8   MyWizardDriverChooseToEnable;
    CHAR16  *MyWizardDriverNvRamAddress;
 } MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION;

#pragma pack()
#endif
```

---
## Slide 36 Lab 5: Update MyWizardDriver.c

**Open** `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.c`

**Copy & Paste** the following 4 lines after the `#include "MyWizardDriver.h"` statement:

```
#include "MyWizardDriver.h"
 
EFI_GUID   mMyWizardDriverVarGuid = MYWIZARDDRIVER_VAR_GUID;
 
CHAR16     mVariableName[] =   L"MWD_NVData";  				// Use Shell "Dmpstore" to see 
MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION   mMyWizDrv_Conf_buffer;
MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION   *mMyWizDrv_Conf = &mMyWizDrv_Conf_buffer;  //use the pointer
```

---
## Slide 37 Lab 5: Update MyWizardDriver.c

**Locate** "`MyWizardDriverDriverBindingStart()`" function

**Copy & Paste** at the beginning of the start function to declare a local variable

```
EFI_STATUS        Status;  // Declare a local variable Status
```

**Copy & Paste** the 6 lines: 1) new call to "`CreateNVVariable();`", 2-6) `if` statement with DEBUG just before the line `return EFI_SUPPORTED` as below:

```
Status = CreateNVVariable();
if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
  DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "***[MyWizardDriver] NV Variable already created /n"));
}
else {
  DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "***[MyWizardDriver] Created NV Variable in the Start /n"));
}

return EFI_SUCCESS;
```

---
## Slide 38 Lab 5: Update MyWizardDriver.c

**Copy & Paste** the new function before the call to "`MyWizardDriverDriverEntryPoint()`"

- **Note:** the `gRT->GetVariable` and `gRT->SetVariable` use Runtime services table
- The Runtime Services Table was not automatically included with the Driver Wizard

```
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
CreateNVVariable()
{
    EFI_STATUS                Status;
    UINTN                  BufferSize;
 
    BufferSize = sizeof (MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION);
    Status = gRT->GetVariable(
        mVariableName,
        &mMyWizardDriverVarGuid,
        NULL,
        &BufferSize,
        mMyWizDrv_Conf
        );
    if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {  // Not definded yet so add it to the NV Variables.
        if (Status == EFI_NOT_FOUND) {
            Status = gRT->SetVariable(
                mVariableName,
                &mMyWizardDriverVarGuid,
                EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE | EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS,
                sizeof (MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION),
                mMyWizDrv_Conf   //  buffer is init before call
                );
            DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, â€œ***[MyWizardDriver] Variable %s created in NVRam Var/n", mVariableName));
            return EFI_SUCCESS;
        }
    }
    // already defined once 
    return EFI_UNSUPPORTED;
}
```

---
## Slide 39 Lab 5: Update MyWizardDriver.h

**Open** "\~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.h"

**Copy & Paste** the following "`#include`" after the list of library include statements:

```
// Libraries
// . . .
#include <Library/UefiRuntimeServicesTableLib.h>
```

**Copy & Paste** the following "`#include`" after the list of protocol include statements:

```
// Produced Protocols
// . . .
#include "MyWizardDriverNVDataStruc.h"
```

**Save** "\~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.h"

---
## Slide 40 Lab 5 - Improvements(1) MyWizardDriver.c

In Lab 4 every time the Supported function was called a Debug message was printed to the Serial port resulting in many messages to examine. Instead, use a different Debug message type for the "Not Supported" Debug message

In the `MyWizardDriverDriverBindingSuppported` function after the call to "OpenProtocol" fails use "`DEBUG_VERBOSE`" instead of "`DEBUG_INFO`" This can be changed by setting the PCD message flag in the DSC file.

```
Status = gBS->OpenProtocol(  . . . 
// . . .
if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
   DEBUG((DEBUG_VERBOSE, "[MyWizardDriver] Not Supported  /n" ));
   return Status; // Bail out if OpenProtocol returns an error
}
```

---
## Slide 41 Lab 5 - Improvements(2) MyWizardDriver.c

It is hard to find the Buffer address in the Debug Message

Before the call to `CreateNVVariable()` in the `MyWizardDriverDriverBindingStart()` Function add the following:

1. Store the address of the Dummy Buffer in the NVRAM Variable
2. Use "`StrCpyS`" to store the string: `UEFI-Training-Class-MWD` to the NVRAM Variable String

```
//  store the address and string value in the NvRam Variable  - 
//  this Allows DMPSTORE to display our buffer address
  mMyWizDrv_Conf_buffer.MyWizardDriverNvRamAddress = DummyBufferfromStart;
  StrCpyS(mMyWizDrv_Conf_buffer.MyWizardDriverStringData, 
		(MYWIZARDDRIVER_STRING_SIZE * sizeof(CHAR16)), 
		L"UEFI-Training-Class-MWD");
```

**Save** "\~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.c"

---
## Slide 42 Lab 5: Build and Test Driver

1. At the Terminal Command Prompt, Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

```
$> cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/
$> python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10 -t GCC5
```

2. Copy `MyWizardDriver.efi` from the build directory to the `VHD Disk`

```
$> cp ../Build/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/DEBUG_GCC5/X64/MyWizardDriver.efi ~/VHD
```

3. Run the firststeps script from Terminal Command Prompt

```
$> ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics
simics> run
```

4. At the Shell, Load Driver

```
Shell> fs1:
FS1:/> load MyWizardDriver.efi
```

```
Shell> fs1:
FS1:\> load MyWizardDriver.efi
Image 'FS1:\MyWizardDriver.efi' loaded at DDD3B000 - Success
FS1:\>
```

---
## Slide 43 Lab 5: Verify the Output

Observe the Buffer address returned by the debug statement in the Simics Serial Console window and the new NV Variable was created

Also note, the "\[MyWizardDriver\] Not Supported" Messages are no longer displayed.

To display these, Set the `PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|0x8040004F` in the DSC file

(See PDF for screenshot)

**Note:** use the right-side scroll bar with mouse to scroll back to see the "Supported SUCCESS"


---
## Slide 44 Lab 5: Verify Driver

Use the Buffer address pointer in the previous slide then use the "mem" command

At the Shell prompt, type `FS0:/> mem 0ddf43018`

Observe the Buffer is filled with the letter "J" ir 0x004A

(See PDF for screenshot)

---
## Slide 45 Lab 5: Verify NVRAM Created by Driver

At the Shell prompt, type `FS1:/> dmpstore -all MWD_NVData`

Observe new the NVRAM variable "MWD_NVData" was created and filled with the address of the buffer and the string "UEFI-Training-Class-MWD"

(See PDF for screenshot)

Buffer address is: `00 00 DD F4 30 18`

Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```

---
## Slide 46 Lab 5: More Porting Needed for the Start

At this point the MyWizardDriver does not manage anything.

The next steps would be to install a protocol to manage the Buffer and NVRAM variable.

---
## Slide 47 Lab 6: Port Stop and Unload

In this lab, you'll port the driver's "Unload" and "Stop" functions to free any resources the driver allocated when it was loaded and started.

## Slide 55 Lab 7: Build the UEFI Driver

- Open `edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/OpenBoard.fdf`
- Add the following in section \[FV.DXEFV\] and after the Shell.inf:

```
INF ShellPkg/Application/Shell/Shell.inf

INF MyPkg/MyWizardDriver/MyWizardDriver.inf
```

- Save and close the file OpenBoard.fdf
- Optional - Update file `C:/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/MyPkg/MyWizardDriver.uni` for `FORM_SET_TITLE` and `FORM1_TITLE`, strings, then save. (Be Creative)
- Open the Visual Studio command prompt
- Build the Simics BoardX58Ich10

```bash
$> cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel
$> python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10 -t GCC5
```

Copy `~/fw/edk2-ws/Build/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/DEBUG_GCC5/FV/BOARDX58ICH10.fd` To `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57/targets/qsp-x86/images`

---
## Slide 56 Lab 7: Verify Driver Got Installed

Run the firststeps script from Terminal Command Prompt:

```bash
$> ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics 
simics> run
```

At the Shell prompt, type `Shell> drivers`

(See PDF for screenshots)

Observe the handle is "98" as this slide example
