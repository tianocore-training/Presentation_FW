## Slide 3 UEFI Driver Wizard

Creating a Template UEFI Driver with the UEFI Driver Wizard


---
## Slide 4 UEFI Driver Wizard Overview

- Open source tool
- Based on Driver Writer's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1 content
- Intel SSG engineers contributed
- Located on [tianocore.org](https://www.tianocore.org/)

## Slide 5 Installing Python for UEFI Driver Wizard

### Requirements and Options

- Work space must contain BaseTools, MdePkg & MdeModulePkg Packages from [UDK2017](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Driver-Developer) for Driver development on tianocore.org
- Uses previous lab's setup `$HOME/src/edk2-ws`
- Python* scripts from [GitHub Link](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-share/tree/master/DriverDeveloper/UefiDriverWizard) then use instructions from README for Python and wxPython versions to install then run

```bash
$ python launch.py
```

---
## Slide 6 Requirements for Your Driver
### Using UEFI Driver Wizard

- UEFI Device Driver
- UEFI Version 2.7 (0x00020046)

```
#define EFI_2_70_SYSTEM_TABLE_REVISION ((2<<16)|(70DEC))
```

- Unloadable driver
- Support IA32 x64 CPUs
- Returns component name information
- Byte stream device (i.e. UART / Serial I/O)
- Option to produce HII strings & forms for setup


---
## Slide 7 Template File Contents

Proper UEFI driver entry point

Basic driver libraries/headers

Skeletons for common driver functions

Error values until ported `EFI_UNSUPPORTED`, `EFI_DEVICE_ERROR`

---
## Slide 8 Lab 1: Create a UEFI Driver with the UEFI Driver Wizard

- In this lab, you'll create a new UEFI driver using the UEFI Driver Wizard.
- This will create a set of "c" code files to be used as a template UEFI Driver used in the subsequent driver labs

---
## Slide 9 Lab 1: Install UEFI Driver Wizard, Python & wxPython

1. Perform [Lab Setup - tentative link](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_L_C_01_Platform_Build_OVMF-QEMU_Lab_guide.md) from previous labs
2. From the `~/FW/DriverWizard` folder, copy and paste folder `~/FW/DriverWizard/UefiDriverWizard` to `~$HOME`
3. Check if version 2.7.x is the default of Python from Terminal Prompt

```bash
$ python -V
Python 2.7.12
```

4. Install the wxPython (Version 3.0)

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0
```
