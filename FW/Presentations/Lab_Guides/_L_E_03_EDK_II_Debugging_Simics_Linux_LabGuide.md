### EDK II Debugging with Linux Lab

[tianocore.org](https://www.tianocore.org/)

---
## Slide 2 Lesson Objective

- Using PCDs to Configure `DebugLib` - LAB
- Change the `DebugLib` instance to modify the debug output - LAB
- Debug EDK II Boot Flow - LAB

---
## Slide 3 Catch up Lab

In this lab, you'll start where the previous Writing UEFI Applications left off.

---
## Slide 4 Lab 0: Catch up from previous lab (1)

Skip to next slide if Writing UEFI App Lab completed

- Perform Lab Setup from previous Labs - [Lab Guide](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_L_C_01_Build_Setup_Download_EDK_II_Linux_LabGuide.md)
- Copy contents of `../FW/LabSampleCode/SampleAppDebug/MyPkg` to `~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2/`
- Open `edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/OpenBoardPkg.dsc` and add the following in the [Components...] section, Hint: add after comment:

```
# Add new modules here
MyPkg/SampleApp/SampleApp.inf
```

- Save and close the file `OpenBoard.dsc`

---
## Slide 5 Lab 0: Catch up from previous lab (2)

Copy the `UefiAppLab.vhd`

From: `.../Lab_Material_FW/FW/LabSampleCode/AppLab/UefiAppLab.vhd`

To `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57/targets/qsp-x86/images`


---
## Slide 6 Lab 0: Catch up from previous lab (3)

Update the Simics Script to Use the `UefiAppLab.vhd` image as a file system

Edit the file: qsp-modern-core.simics from `Simics-Install-Directory/simics-qsp-cpu-6.0.4/targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics`

Add the following Line:

```
$disk1_image="%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/images/UefiAppLab.vhd"
```

Before the `run-command-file` line

Save `qsp-modern-core.simics`

**File: qsp-modern-core.simics**

```
Decl{
decl {
! Script that runs the Quick Start Platform (QSP) with a modern 
!   processor core. 

params from "%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/qsp-clear-linux.simics"  
default cpu_comp_class = "x86QSP2"

```
#include <Library/DebugLib.h>
```


---
## Slide 9 Lab 1: Add debug statements to SampleApp

Locate the UefiMain function. Then copy and paste the following code after the `EFI_INPUT_KEY  KEY;` statement: and before the first `Print()` statement as shown in the code block below:

```
DEBUG ((0xffffffff, "/n/nUEFI Base Training DEBUG DEMO/n") );
DEBUG ((0xffffffff, "0xffffffff USING DEBUG ALL Mask Bits Set/n") );

DEBUG ((DEBUG_INIT,     " 0x%08x USING DEBUG DEBUG_INIT/n" , (UINTN)(DEBUG_INIT))  );

$  cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2
$  . edksetup.sh
$  cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/
$  python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10  -t GCC5

```

Copy `SampleApp.efi` from the build directory to the `VHD Disk`

```bash

## Slide 11 Lab 1: Build, Run and Test Result

Open another Terminal Command Prompt

```bash
$ cd  simics-projects/my-simics-project-1
```

Run the firststeps script:

```
$ ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics
simics> run
```

(Press "F2" at the logo, then select "Boot Manager" followed by "EFI Internal Shell")

At the Shell prompt

```
Shell> Fs1:
FS1:/> SampleApp

## Slide 21 Lab 5: Debugging EDK II add Debug to Boot Flow

In this lab, you'll learn how add Debug statements to the EDK II Boot flow and check the debug log output

---
## Slide 22 Lab 5: Debug Boot Flow

Edit the `MdeModulePkg/Core/Pei/PeiMain/PeiMain.c` and add a "DEBUG" print \~line 489 before the call to the PeiDispatcher:

```
DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "***** ***** *****Before call to Pei Dispatcher ***** ***** *****/n"));
```

Save PeiMain.c

```
// Call PEIM dispatcher
//
DEBUG((DEBUG_INFO, "***** ***** *****Before call to Pei Dispatcher ***** ***** *****\n"));
PeiDispatcher (SecCoreData, &PrivateData);
```

---
## Slide 23 Lab 5: Build and Test SampleApp

1. At the Terminal Command Prompt, Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

```bash
$ cd ~/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/
$ python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10  -t GCC5
```

2. Copy the Simics QSP Board .FD file `~/fw/edk2-ws/Build/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/DEBUG_GCC5/FV/BOARDX58ICH10.fd` To `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Programs/Simics/simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57/targets/qsp-x86/images`

3. Run the firststeps script from Terminal Command Prompt:

```bash
$ ./simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics
simics> run   
```

4. Scroll back in the Simics Serial Console to find the  Debug statement before the PEI Dispatcher. This would be a place to debug a PEIM

(See PDF for screenshot)

5. Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```
