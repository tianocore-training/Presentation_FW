## Slide 2 Lesson Objectives

First Seup for Building EDK II, See [Lab Setup](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_C_01_Build_Setup_Download_EDK_II_Win_LabGuide.md)
then [Platform Build Lab for Simics](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_C_02_Platform_Build_Win_Simics_LabGuide.md)

- UEFI Application with PCDs
- Simple UEFI Application
- Add functionality to UEFI Application
- Using EADK with UEFI Application (Optional)


---
## Slide 3 UEFI Application w/ PCDs

<br>


---
## Slide 4 EDK II PCD's Purpose and Goals (Review)

Documentation: [link](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Universal/PCD/Dxe/Pcd.inf)

**Purpose**

- Establishes platform common definitions
- Build-time/Run-time aspects
- Binary Editing Capabilities


**Goals**

- Simplify porting
- Easy to associate with a module or platform


---
## Slide 5 PCD Syntax (Review)

PCDs can be located anywhere within the Workspace even though a different package will use those PCDs for a given project

**.DEC  -  Define PCD  -  Package**

**.INF  -  Reference PCD  -  Module**

**.DSC  -  Modify PCD  -  Platform**


Note:

- The Platform configuration database is generated by the build process parsing the build description files that define and specify PCD entries.

- What we see on this slide is how the PCD data is being used in various levels of the build description files

- First we have the DEC file – this Defines a list of PCD tokens that modules can use. 
 	It Defines the PCD entries that will exist under the GUID for that  package, the PCD restriction, valid types for the PCD, and a default value for the PCD. There is a whole syntax and how to define a PCD in the DEC file.

- Next we have PCB entries in the INF file- and this Defines the usage of PCD tokens by the module.
	It Defines what PCD entries are being used within the module, the PCD restriction (or DYNAMIC for none), and a Optional default value for the PCD within this module only.

- Next is the DSC file – This is at the Platform level and describes the contents of the build for a specific platform. 
	PCD entries are assigned values and types for the platform build. You would define a value here to be used by that platform. The value could be different when it is defined in the DEC file but the value in the DSC would be the final value . And They Cannot conflict with established restrictions.

- Not on this slide but also there is the FDF build description File – and this file would have flash layout related values

## Slide 17 Lab 2: Write a Simple UEFI Application

In this lab, you'll learn how to write simple UEFI applications

---
## Slide 18 LAB 2 Writing a Simple UEFI Application

In this lab, you'll learn how to write simple UEFI applications.

**"C" file**

```c
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{
  return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

**.inf file**

```shell
[Defines]
  INF_VERSION       =
  BASE_NAME         =
  FILE_GUID 		=
  MODULE_TYPE       =
  VERSION_STRING    =             
  ENTRY_POINT       =

[Sources]
  
[Packages]
    
[LibraryClasses]
```

- What goes into a Simplest "C"
- Start with what should go into the Simplest .INF file

---
## Slide 19 Application Lab - start with .c and .inf template

Copy the `LabSampleCode/SampleApp/MyPkg` directory to `C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2` 

Edit **SampleApp.inf**

- Look in the INF for "XXXXXXXXXXX" sections that will need information
- Create Name & GUID, and then fill in the MODULE_TYPE

---
## Slide 20 Lab 2: Sample Application INF File

```
[Defines]
  INF_VERSION         = 0x00010005
  BASE_NAME           = XXXXXXXXXXXX
  FILE_GUID           = XXXXXXXXXXXX
  MODULE_TYPE         = XXXXXXXXXXXX
  VERSION_STRING      = 1.0
  ENTRY_POINT         = UefiMain

[Sources]
  XXXXXXXXX
[Packages]
  #XXXXXXXX
  
[LibraryClasses]
  #XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    
[Guids]
 # . . .
```

Get a GUID [guidgenerator.com/](https://www.guidgenerator.com/) or [https://www.guidgen.com/](https://www.guidgen.com/)


---
## Slide 21 Lab 2: Sample Application 'C' file

```
/** @file
  This is a simple shell application
**/
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{
  return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

This application does not do anything but return Success

---
## Slide 22 Lab 2: Will it compile now?

Not yet...

1. Need to add headers to the .C file
2. Need to add a reference to INF from the platform DSC
3. Need to add a few Package dependencies and libraries to the .INF


Note:

- So the question is will it compile now?
- And the answer is no it will not compile yet
- First you need to add some headers to the.C. we need to be able to let some things.
- We need to add a reference to the INF from the platform in DSC.  Because If you build it now the build is going to say I don’t have a platform and so the build is going to break. 
- Then the next thing we need to add is a few package dependencies and libraries to the INF file because, for instance, features like the UEFI Application entry point will need to be added, because it doesn’t know how to do an entry point until you’ve added that. 

---
## Slide 23 Application Lab - Update Files

1. .DSC (`edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/OpenBoardPkg.dsc`)
  - [Components . . .]<br>
	Add INF to components section, before build options<br>
	Hint: add after comment `# Add new modules here`<br>
	`MyPkg/SampleApp/SampleApp.inf`

2. .INF File (`MyPkg/SampleApp/SampleApp.inf`)
  - Packages (all depend on MdePkg)
```
  [Packages]
    MdePkg/MdePkg.dec
  [LibraryClasses]
    UefiApplicationEntryPoint
```

3. .C file - Header references file (`MyPkg/SampleApp/SampleApp.c`)

```c
  #include <Uefi.h>
  #include <Library/UefiApplicationEntryPoint.h> 
```

## Slide 32 Lab 2.1: Build Switches

In this lab, you'll remove the build switches to be always TRUE


---
## Slide 33 Build MACRO Switches

The build for BoardX58Ich10 OpenBoardPkg is using build MACRO Switch: 

`-D ADD_SHELL_STRING` - used to change a string in the UEFI Shell application, only used for EDK II Training (requirs ShellPkg be re-built on a change of this switch)

File OpenBoardPkg.dsc (apx. line 270)  - Notice: `!if $(ADD_SHELL_STRING) == TRUE` below
```
  ShellPkg/Application/Shell/Shell.inf {
    <PcdsFixedAtBuild>
      gEfiShellPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdShellLibAutoInitialize|FALSE
    <LibraryClasses>
      NULL|ShellPkg/Library/UefiShellLevel2CommandsLib/UefiShellLevel2CommandsLib.inf

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```

---
## Slide 36 Lab 2.1: Compiling w/ Build Switch

### Add the Build Switch `-D ADD_SHELL_STRING`

**Two Ways:**

1. Update Python Script or
2. Add list of DEFINES in .DSC file (Preferred)


### Method 1

The Build command is part of the python script, build_bios.py

Notice the Build command from the python script for BoardX58Ich10:

```
...
Calling build -n 0 --log=Build.log --report-file=BuildReport.log
...
```

Update line 388 of build_bios.py to include `-D ADD_SHELL_STRING`

```python
command = ["build", "-n", config["NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS"], "-D", "ADD_SHELL_STRING"]
```

Re-Build BoardX58Ich10
From a Terminal Command Prompt

```bash
$> cd C:\FW\edk2-ws\edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\
$> python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10  -t VS20XX
```
Notice as the build is called the "`-D ADD_SHELL_STRING`" is added

```
...
Calling build -n 0 -D ADD_SHELL_STRING --log=Build.log --report-file=BuildReport.log
...
```

---
## Slide 37 Lab 2.1: Compiling w/ Build Switch

1. Invoke Simics and Test Shell `Ver` Command


`Copy  C:\fw\edk2-ws\Build\SimicsOpenBoardPkg\BoardX58Ich10\DEBUG_VS20XX\FV\BOARDX58ICH10.fd` 

**To**

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Simics\simics-qsp-x86-6.0.57\targets\qsp-x86\images`


Run the qsp-modern-core script from Terminal Command Prompt

```bash
$> .\simics targets/qsp-x86/qsp-modern-core.simics
simics> run
``` 

Press "F2" at the logo, then select "Boot Manager" followed by "EFI Internal Shell"

At the UEFI Shell prompt, type: ver

```
Shell> ver
UEFI Interactive Shell v2.2 -From ADD_SHELL_STRING Switch
EDK II

Shell>
```

Exit Simics

```
simics> stop
simics> quit
```

---
## Slide 38 Lab 2.1: Compiling w/ Build Switch

### Method 2

Add list of DEFINES in .DSC file. This is the **preferred** method for EDK II when a Build script is used

1. Update line 388 of build_bios.py and remove the "-D ADD_SHELL_STRING", then Save
2. Edit the file `C:/fw/edk2-ws/edk2-platforms/Platform/Intel/SimicsOpenBoardPkg/BoardX58Ich10/OpenBoardPkgBuildOption.dsc`
- Add the following DEFINE after Line 7
- Save after update

```
[Defines]
# For UEFI / EDK II Training
# This flag is to enable a different ver string for building of the ShellPkg
# These can be changed on the command line.
#
  DEFINE  ADD_SHELL_STRING        = TRUE
```

Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

From a Visual Studio Command Prompt


```bash
$> Cd C:\FW\edk2-ws\edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\
$> python build_bios.py -p BoardX58Ich10  -t VS20XX

```

---
## Slide 39 Lab 2.1: Compiling w/ Build Switch 

Invoke Simics and test Shell `Ver` command

`Copy  C:\fw\edk2-ws\Build\SimicsOpenBoardPkg\BoardX58Ich10\DEBUG_VS20XX\FV\BOARDX58ICH10.fd`

## Slide 40 Knowledge Check from LAB 2

1. How to write a simple native UEFI Application
2. Each module requires a .inf file with a unique GUID (use [link](https://www.guidgenerator.com/))
3. The module created will be the base name defined in the .inf file
4. The module's .inf file is required to be included in the platform .dsc file
5. The [Packages] section is required at minimum to include MdePkg/MdePkg.dec
6. When using a Build Switch (-D) on the command line it overrides the value in the .DSC file

---
## Slide 41 Lab 2: If there are build errors...

See class files for the solution from: `Lab_Material_FW\LabSampleCode`

1. Copy the `FW\LabSampleCode\SampleApp\MyPkg` directory to `C:\FW\edk2-ws\edk2`
2. See class files for the solution `...FW\LabSampleCode\LabSolutions\LessonB.2`
3. Copy the .inf and .c files to  `C:\FW\edk2-ws\edk2\MyPkg\SampleApp`
4. Search sample DSC for reference to SampleApp.inf and add this line to your workspace DSC file
`C:\FW\edk2-ws\edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\SimicsBoardPkg\BoardX58Ich10\OpenBoard.dsc`  (near the bottom)
```
   MyPkg/SampleApp/SampleApp.inf
```
Invoke  python build script again and check the solution


---
## Slide 42 Add Functionality

Add Functionality to the Simple UEFI Appication:
Next 3 Labs

**Lab 3:** Print the UEFI System Table

**Lab 4:**  Wait for an Event

**Lab 5:** Create a Simple typewriter function & Create a PCD to enable

Solutions in `.../FW/LabSampleCode/LabSolutions/LessonB.n`

---
## Slide 43 Lab 3: Print the UEFI System Table

Add code to print the hex address of the EFI System Table pointer to the console

---
## Slide 44 Lab 3: Add System Table Code

Add code to print to the console the hex address of the system table pointer

- Where is the "print" function
- Where does the app get the pointer value? (compared to mem command below)

```
FS1:\> mem
...
Valid EFI Header at Address: 00000000DEFED018
...
FS1:> SampleApp
System Table: 0xDEFED018
```

Note:

- So let’s extend this and give it something useful to do
 - so for this example we are going to have our sample application print out the system table pointer
- So how do we do that. Well remember to find a function we want we can use the help documentation or CHM file.so what we will find if we do this is that the print function is part of the UefiLib. So in order to add the print functionality we would need to add the UefiLib  to our list of library classes in our INF file
- To see this example look in the files in our sample lab code .c and .inf.
- So also as an exercise you can look at the file in the sample lab code Min.dsc, this is a platform description file without a platform or any packages that go with it,  and this demonstrates the minimal contents for a DSC file that can build this application. So it will build a single application orientated toward the one we just created except nothing else. So unlike the Emulator platform description file, if you were to look at it, There are huge amounts of other components, library classes, and all of that, this Min.dsc only does the minimum requirements.

## Slide 48 Lab 4: Waiting for an Event

In this lab, you'll learn how to locate code and .chm files to help write EFI code for waiting for an event

---
## Slide 49 Lab 4: Add Wait for Event

Add code to make your application wait for a key press event (`WaitForEvent` / `WaitForKey`)

```
Press ESC in 2 seconds to skip startup.nsh or any other key to continue.
Shell> fs1:
FS1:\> SampleApp
System Table: 0xDEFD018

Press any Key to continue :


```
- Where are these functions located?
- What else can you do with the key press?



Note:

- Add code to make your application wait for an event (WaitForEvent) and use the (WaitForKey) as the event

- Hint: use the MdePkg.chm to find where the "WaitForEvent" and the "WaitForKey" functions are located
- Another Hint: The system table is passed in as a parameter to your sample application
- Search the EDK II code for "WaitForEvent"
- Test by running your application in the Shell

---
## Slide 50 Lab 4: HOW?

Locate Functions: `WaitForEvent` / `WaitForKey`

- Search MdePkg.chm - "MdePkg Document With Libraries.chm" located in `Lab_Material_FW/FW/Documentation`
  - Locate `WaitForEvent` in Boot Services
  - Locate `WaitForKey` and find (`EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL` will be part of ConIn)
- Check the [UEFI Spec](https://uefi.org/) for parameters needed:
  - `WaitForEvent` is referenced via Boot Services pointer, which is referenced via EFI System Table
  - `WaitForKey` can be referenced through the EFI System Table passed into the application
- **OR** Search the working space for `WaitForEvent` for an example
- One can be found in [MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c) ~ In 568.

---
## Slide 51 Lab 4: Update the C File for `WaitForKey`

Search the *work space* and find the following MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c ~ In 563:

```c
...
UINTN               EventIndex;     // Line 410
...
  // If we encounter error, continue to read another key in.
  //
    if (Status != EFI_NOT_READY) {
      continue;
    }
    gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey, &EventIndex);  //Line 563
  }
...   
```

Add the following to SampleApp.c

```
UINTN                      EventIndex; 
Print(L"System Table: 0x%p\n",SystemTable);   //From Lab 3
Print(L"\nPress any Key to continue : \n");
gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey, &EventIndex);
```

---
## Slide 52 Lab 4: Test Compile

However, this won't compile ... `gBS` and `gST` are not defined

The build error will be similar to: "`...error C2065: 'gSt'  : undeclared identifier ...`"
- (See PDF for example of compilation errors)

Search the MdePkg.chm for "`gBS`" and "`gST`" - they are located in `UefiBootServicesTableLib.h`

Add the boot services lib to SampleApp.c

```c
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
```

(hint: Lesson B.4 has the solution)

---
## Slide 53 Lab 4: Update for gBS & gST

```c
#include <Uefi.h>
#include <Library/UefiApplicationEntryPoint.h>
#include <Library/UefiLib.h>
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
// . . .
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{ 
  UINTN                EventIndex;
  Print(L"System Table: 0x%p\n", SystemTable); 
  Print(L"\nPress any Key to  continue :\n");
  gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey, &EventIndex);
  return EFI_SUCCESS; 
}

```

---
## Slide 54 Lab 4: Build and Test SampleApp

1. At the Visual Studio Command Prompt, Re-Build BoardX58Ich10

## Slide 55 Lab 5: Creating a Simple Typewriter Function

In this lab, you'll learn how to create a simple typewriter function that retrieves the keys you type and subsequently prints each one back to the console

---
## Slide 56 Lab 5 : Typewriter Function

Create a simple Typewriter Function using the SampleApp from Lab 4

**Requirements:**

- If the Typewriter Function is enabled
- Retrieve keys entered from keyboard (like Lab 4)
- Print back each key entered to the console
- To exit, press "." (DOT) and then \<Enter\>


It should look similar to the following:
```
Shell> fs1:
FS1:\> SampleApp
System Table: 0xDEFED018

Press any Key to continue :
Enter text. Include a dot ('.') in a sentence then <Enter> to exit:
this is the first line of the typewriter feature function.
FS1:\>
```

---
## Slide 57 Lab 5 : Typerwriter Function

Create a simple Typewriter Function using the SampleApp from Lab 4

**How:**

1. Create a Feature Flag PCD to Enable
2. Add a Loop using `WaitForEvent` with `WaitForKey`
3. Use the `ReadKeyStroke` function from `ConIn`
4. Print back each key to console
5. Exit when DOT "." character is followed by an \<Enter\> key

---
## Slide 58 Lab 5: How Process (Hints)


1. Refer to Lab 1 for how PCDs work and create a PCD in the Platform DEC file.
2. Use the same procedure as with Lab 4 to find `ReadKeyStroke` in the workspace: 
[MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c) 
~ In 552 <br>
    - `Status = gST->ConIn->ReadKeyStroke (gST->ConIn, Key);`
3. Funtion `ReadKeyStroke` uses a buffer called `EFI_INPUT_KEY` ~ In 393
    - `OUT EFI_INPUT_KEY *Key,`

    - TIP: Good idea to zero out a buffer in your function -
      - Use MdePkg.chm to find `ZeroMem` function
      - Use `ZeroMem` function on your variable buffer "Key" of type EFI_INPUT_KEY
4. Use Boolean flag "ExitLoop" to exit your loop once the user enters a DOT "." character


---
## Slide 59 Lab 5: How Process (Hints)

**How to create a Feature Flag PCD**

1. Check the MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec and search for the "PcdHelloWorldPrintEnable" PCD.
    - Notice that it is in the \[PcdsFeatureFlag\] section
2. Add a similar section in MyPkg, `edk2/MyPkg/MyPkg.dec` file and add a flag “PcdTypeWriterFeatureEnable” default, TRUE. (it can be added to the end of the file)
3. Next Update the SampleApp.inf to include: `MyPkg/MyPkg.dec`, the new PCD, and the `PcdLib` ( hint, see how HelloWorld.inf used the PCD enable )
4. SampleApp.c can now use the newly created PCD 

---
## Slide 60 Lab 5: Solution: Dec & Inf

**MyPkg/MyPkg.dec**

```
[PcdsFeatureFlag]
 ## Indicates if SampleApp Application will enable the Typewriter Feature.
  #  This PCD is a sample to explain FeatureFlag PCD usage.<BR><BR>

## Slide 63 Lab 5: Bug Reports

You received the following bug reports on your SampleApp UEFI Application

1. If an "Enter" Key is pressed before the "." character, there is no line feed to go to a new line like a real typewriter would do.
2. Since the DOT "." is used in sentences a different character other than a "." is required to exit the Typewriter function. One suggestion was to use the "ESC" character instead.
3. Some customers would like the application without the typewriter feature enabled.

How would you add these fixed to the SampleApp UEFI application?

---
## Slide 64 Lab 5.1: Bug Fixes


(hint: Lesson B.5. has the solution)

Add a line feed character after a "Enter" key.
